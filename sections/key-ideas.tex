\subsection{Key Ideas}
\label{key:sec}

Overall, these observations indicate that the names of the variables
in a particular function not only depend on {\em the task} in which
the variable is used to implement (called {\bf task-specific context}), but
their names are also affected by {\em their own properties and roles} in the
code (called {\bf single-variable usage context}) and on the {\em names of the
other variables} in the same function (called {\bf multiple-variable usage
  context}).
