\subsubsection{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

%There are rooms for improvements in {\tool}.
First, it does not perform well in name prediction for the original
code with the short and meaningless names, e.g., \code{i}, \code{j},
etc. In this case, the type of the variable could not help because the
name and type are not in accordance. The relations among the variables
do not help either because there does not exist the natural-language
semantic connections among their names. Second, {\tool} does not
produce well long variable names with several sub-tokens. One solution
could be to replace the GRU decoder with a better model that can
predict the length of the name and the name itself. Third, for the
type prediction, {\tool} works not so well for the user-defined types
with long names. Fourth, in some cases, the types did not
help learn the variable name because the types are generic and
any variable name could be used.
