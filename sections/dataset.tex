%To compare with the state-of-the-art variable name prediction
%approaches and the state-of-the-art variable type prediction
%approaches,

\subsubsection*{Dataset} We have conducted our experiments to evaluate {\tool} on the
well-established Python dataset, ManyTypes4Py provided in a prior work
by Mir {\em et al.}~\cite{mir2021manytypes4py}. The dataset includes
+180k methods from 4,000 Python projects with 37,408 different
variable types. We applied Pyminifier~\cite{pyminifier}, a
minification tool for Python code to minify the variable names in the
source files. {\color{blue}{We also used a dataset provided in a prior
work, JSNeat~\cite{icse19}. The JS dataset includes +320k
methods from 20,000 projects with 176k unique variable names. We
minified them with the minifying tool UglifyJS~\cite{uglify}}}.
