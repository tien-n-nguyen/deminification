\subsection{Datasets}

To compare with the state-of-the-art variable name prediction approaches and the state-of-the-art variable type prediction approaches, we have conducted our evaluation on the python dataset ManyTypes4Py released by Mir et al. \cite{mir2021manytypes4py}, which includes 37,408 different variable types and 180k+ methods from around 4,000 python projects. The ManyTypes4Py dataset contains the variable types summarization. To make it also works for variable name prediction task. We applied the pyminifier \cite{pyminifier} tool to minify the variable names in each method.
