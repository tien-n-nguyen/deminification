We use Figure~\ref{rel-graph} as an example to explain how our
variable name generation model works. Because when we use different
code minification tools to process the same source code, the minified
variable names could be different. In this case, the minified variable
names do not have fixed meanings in different codes with varying
minification tools. So in our variable name generation model, when the
generated combined graph comes in, we regard the node $n_r, n_q, n_d$
with the minified variable names such as $r, q, d$ in
Figure~\ref{rel-graph} as the nodes with missing node features. After
feeding the graph into the GCNmf model, it will randomly create
representation vectors $v_r, v_q, v_d$ for nodes $n_r, n_q, n_d$ at
first. During the convolution process, the representation vectors
$v_r, v_q, v_d$ will be automatically updated based on the neighbor
node features and the connection relationships. When the convolution
process is finished, the final stage of representation vectors $v'_r,
v'_q, v'_d$ for nodes $n_r, n_q, n_d$ are fed into the GRU decoder to
predict minified variable names. At the same time, the final
representation vectors for each node can be used in the type
generation model for the type prediction.
