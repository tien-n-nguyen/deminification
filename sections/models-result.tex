Table~\ref{tab:sensi-graph} shows the accuracy of the variant model
as we replaced the graph neural network EE-GCN with the Label Graph
Convolutional Network (Label-GCN)~\cite{label-gcn}. We did not replace
GCNmf because it is the core component in our solution, which
formulates the name/type recovery as the prediction of missing
features. As seen, Edge-Enhanced GCN helps improve accuracy more than
Label-GCN. EE-GCN enables the modeling of different types of relations
because it handles different edge types in different channels, while
Label-GCN just integrates the edge information as simple labels.
This is crucial for our problem in which the type dependencies
and the variable relations are well captured.




%2. EEGCN is a more advanced model by representing the edge in $N$ channels instead of a simple label compared with label-GCN (EEGCN+GCNmf+RG compared with LGCN+GCNmf+RG on both two tables)
