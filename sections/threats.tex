\subsubsection{Threats to Validity}
\label{sec:threats}

We evaluated in one dataset, which might not be
representative. However, the dataset has been verified and used in
prior work. {\tool} currently works for Python only. Other programming
languages could be supported. One needs to implement the tools to
extract the relation graph and type dependency graph for the new
language. The model itself is intact. Because some of the baselines
for variable name recovery were designed for JavaScript, we
re-implemented based on their source code. We also got helps from one
of the authors of JSNeat during re-implementation. We kept all the
parameters in their tools as in their documentation or original source code.

%Because all of these three
%baselines are designed for JavaScript, we reimplement them based on
%their source code and design to make them can work on python. To keep
%the baselines in their original track, we keep all parameters the same
%as in their original research studies.
