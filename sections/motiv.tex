\label{example_sim}
\end{figure}

Let us start with a real-world example to motivate our approach.
Figures~\ref{example_org} and~\ref{example_sim} show the original and
minified versions~of the function \code{exportSelection}.  The
function is aimed to export/retrieve the selection from a document.
%
In the minified code, all local variables were randomly renamed with
short and meaningless names, \eg \code{root} becomes \code{w},
\code{doc} becomes \code{b}, etc. by a minification tool.
%\eg UglifyJS~\cite{uglifyJS}.
This makes them difficult to comprehend.

%\subsection{Observations}

We aim to recover the names of the variables in the minified
code. Such process is not trivial and affected by multiple factors.
Let us explain the following observations then to motivate our
solution:

\vspace{2pt} \textbf{Observation 1.} {\em The mutual impact between
  variable name learning and variable type learning.} If a model
learns correctly the type of a variable, it would help to learn better
the name of the variable and vice versa. Let us consider the name
\code{emptyBlocksIndex} for the variable \code{y} at line 24 in
Figure~\ref{example_sim}: \code{if (y != -1)}. From that comparison, a
model could learn that \code{y} is of the type \code{int}. Knowing
that it is an integer, a model could combine that with the knowledge
learned from line 23 (\code{var y =
  this.getIndexRelativeToAdjacentEmptyBlocks(...)}), and predict the
name for \code{y} could be {\em ``Index''} or similar. On
the other hand, correct learning of a variable name can also benefit
for learning of its type. At line 18 of Figure~\ref{example_sim}, if
the name \code{trailingImageCount} is recovered for the variable
\code{a}, then its type is likely to be \code{int} if the model could
make sense of the sub-tokens \code{image} and \code{count}.

\vspace{2pt} \noindent {\bf Key Idea 1.} [{\bf Dual-task Learning
    between Name Prediction and Type Prediction}] {\em While focusing
  on recovering variable names in minified code, we leverage the
  duality between the learning to predict the variable names and the
  learning to predict the variable types.} In the original code, the
name of a variable should be natural (unsurprising) with respect to
the type of that variable. We build a name prediction model and a type
prediction one, and we apply a dual-task learning mechanism between
the two models.

\vspace{2pt}
\textbf{Observation 2}. {\em The name and type of a variable can be
  affected by the names and types of the surrounding variables in a
  function.}  Intuitively, because multiple variables are used
together to achieve the common task in the function, their names are
often consistent with one another. For example, at line 7, the choice
of the name \code{range} in the recovery process could be influenced
by the choice of the variable \code{selection} as the call to
\code{getRangeAt} is made on that variable as in the statement
\code{range} = \code{selection.getRangeAt(0)}. The choice of the name
\code{preSelectionRange} could be affected by the choice of the
variable \code{range} due to the statement \code{preSelectionRange} =
\code{range.cloneRange()}. Moreover, the type system in a programming
language always requires the concordance between the types of
variables. For example, the types of two sides of an assignment must
be consistent.

\vspace{2pt}
\noindent {\bf Key Idea 2.} [{\bf Relations among Variables in a
    Function}] {\em A variable name or type are influenced by the
  names or the properties of the other variables having the relations
  with that variable} in the surrounding context. We {\bf treat the
  problem of variable name generation as predicting the missing
  features} in a graph neural network by leveraging Graph Convolution
Network - Missing Features (GCNmf)~\cite{GCNmf}.  We also use
Edge-Enhanced Graph Convolution Networks (EE-GCN)~\cite{ee-gcn} to
model different kinds of relations among the
variables and types in the function/method.


%For example, a model can be trained from the assignment
%\code{preSelectionRange} = \code{range.cloneRange()} to predict the
%variable name on the left-hand side of \code{X =
%range.cloneRange()}. In other cases, a model can learn the names that
%often appear together in several methods in the training corpus. For
%example, the variable names \code{selection}, \code{selectionState},
%\code{range}, and \code{preSelectionRange}.

\vspace{2pt} \textbf{Observation 3}. {\em The actual variable name
  must also be in accordance with the names of the accessed fields and
  called methods}. For example, in the original code in
Figure~\ref{example_org}, the variable name \code{range} makes sense
in \code{range.startOffset} and \code{range.endOffset} because a range
could have a start offset and an ending offset. The rationale is that
in the orignal code, for easy code comprehension, developers tend to
use the naming conventions and meaningful names with respect to the
surrounding names in the code. In other words, the predicted name of a
variable and those of its properties (fields and methods) are in
accordance. As another example, \code{preSelectionRange} and
\code{setEnd} are in accordance with each other in
\code{preSelectionRange.setEnd} at line 9. In fact, there exist
approaches to explore the concordance between the method's name and
the names of its arguments to detect name-based bugs in a
program~\cite{deepbugs-oopsla18}.

\vspace{2pt}
\textbf{Observation 4}. {\em The fields and methods of a variable are
  kept intact after minification.} If the names of the fields and
methods were minified, the corresponding field accesses and method
calls would not be valid anymore. For example, \code{cloneRange()} in
\code{r.cloneRange()} at line 7 and \code{startContainer} in
\code{r.startContainer} at line 9 in Figure~\ref{example_org} are
unchanged in Figure~\ref{example_sim}. Due to that, a model can rely
on the names of those properties of a variable to predict the
variable's name.

\vspace{2pt}
\noindent {\bf Key Idea 3.} [{\bf Properties of a Variable}] {\em The
  name of a variable $v$ is in accordance with its own properties}
including the names of its fields in field accesses and the names of
its methods in the method calls on the variable $v$.
%
Moreover, the names of the fields and methods are kept intact after
minification, thus, a model can rely on those names to predict the
names of the variables. For example, a model can be trained to learn
from the variables that have the field accesses to
\code{startContainer}, \code{endContainer}, \code{startOffset}, and
\code{endOffset}, and have the method calls to \code{cloneRange()}.
It then uses that knowledge to predict the variable type and the name
\code{range}.
