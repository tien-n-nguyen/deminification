\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduce {\tool}, a Deep-Learning (DL)-based approach that
formulates that recovery problem as the predicting the missing
features in a variant of Graph Convolution Network. The graph
represents both the relations among the variables and the relations
among their types in a function/method. {\tool} also leverages
dual-task learning to propagate the mutual impact between the learning
of the variable names and that of their types. We have conducted
experiments to evaluate {\tool} in both name recovery and type
prediction on a real-world dataset with +63K Python files. For
variable name prediction, in 76.7\% of the cases, {\tool} can predict
correctly the variables' names with a single suggested name. {\tool}
relatively improves from 15--40.7\% in top-1 accuracy over the
state-of-the-art variable name recovery approaches. Top-1 accuracy for
type prediction is 79\%. It relatively improves XX\%--YY\% in top-1
accuracy over the existing type prediction approaches.
