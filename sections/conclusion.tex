\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduce {\tool}, a Deep-Learning (DL)-based approach that
formulates that recovery problem as the predicting the missing
features in a variant of Graph Convolution Network. The graph
represents both the relations among the variables and the relations
among their types in a method. {\tool} also leverages
dual-task learning to propagate the mutual impact between the learning
of the variable names and that of their types. We have conducted
experiments to evaluate {\tool}.
%For variable name prediction, in 76.7\% of the cases, {\tool} can
%predict correctly the variables' names with a single
%suggestion.
{\tool} relatively improves from 15.3--40.7\% in top-1
accuracy over the existing variable name recovery approaches.
%Top-1 accuracy for type prediction is 79\%.
It relatively improves 14.5\%--51.9\% in top-1 accuracy over the
existing type prediction approaches.
