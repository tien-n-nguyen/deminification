\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduce {\tool}, a Deep-Learning (DL)-based approach that
formulates name recovery problem as the predicting the missing
features in Graph Convolution Network-Missing Features.  The learning
of types and names are mutual to support both tasks of name and type
recovery.  The graph represents both the relations among the variables
and those among their types. {\tool} also leverages dual-task learning
to propagate the mutual impact between the learning of the variable
names and that of their types. Our experiments to evaluate {\tool}
show that
%For variable name prediction, in 76.7\% of the cases, {\tool} can
%predict correctly the variables' names with a single
%suggestion.
{\tool} relatively improves from 15.3--40.7\% in top-1
accuracy over the existing variable name recovery approaches.
%Top-1 accuracy for type prediction is 79\%.
It relatively improves 14.5\%--51.9\% in top-1 accuracy over the
existing type prediction approaches.

We plan to explore the
GCN-Missing Features in other problems in traditional languages, e.g.,
Java in which the attributes of a node could possess the domain logic,
or other properties, e.g., values.
