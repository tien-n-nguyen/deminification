\subsection{Approach Overview}

From the observations, we propose an IR-based, data-driven approach to
recover the variables' names in a minified JS code based
on the contextual information
%of the variables
including \textit{single-variable usage context} (SVC),
\textit{multiple-variable usage context} (MVC), and
\textit{task-specific context} (TSC).
%
We initially construct a database to store
%the information about
the variables' names and the corresponding context information
extracted from a large corpus of JS code.
%
To recover the names, given a minified JS code, we first use
the \textit{SVC} and \textit{TSC} information to find in our
database the candidate names for each variable. Then, these candidates
for each variable are ranked by the likelihood that they are used
along with the candidates of other variables, in order to name the
variables in the same function by using~\textit{MVC}.
